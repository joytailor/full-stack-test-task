Before running the project, please disable the Same-origin-policy in your browser (seems like requirements for security now quite tough, so it's helpless to just use special headers on the back-end). You may easily do this by simply adding this extension for chrome https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en

When it's ready - run yarn add and then yarn start at the /server folder, after repeat all the same in the /client folder.
